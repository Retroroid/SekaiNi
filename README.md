# SekaiNi
Zyjacya

SekaiNi is a free, open-source, and standalone world-engine and toolbox for use in D&D.

Currently implemented:
D100 Editor (Import lists from text, edit list item attributes, and rolling)

Planned:

Character
Establishment/Building
Event
Faction
Generator
Guildhall
Item
Location
Module

Each of these will have an Editor and Database Viewer.

Additionally, these items will be able to be connected to each other and allow opening of the entity's editor from any place it is referenced.
This is intended to allow quick reference and changes that result in a consistent and dynamic setting for D&D.
