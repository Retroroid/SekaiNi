SekaiNi is a free, open-source, and standalone world-engine and toolbox for use in D&D. Specifically, this tool is designed for use by 
DMs in order to allow them to more easily generate, connect, and keep consistent smaller parts of a setting, allowing their
attention to be devoted to subjects of larger scale and interest.

Currently, each type has an editor (except generator), and they can be edited, saved, and loaded anywhere (or at least they should be. This is likely not the case quite yet as I am still developing much of the program. Testers appreciated in helping me find the problems.) This allows consistency in settings such that a change made in one place persists across all places it is referenced.
